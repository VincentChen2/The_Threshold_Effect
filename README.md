# Random Graphs and the Threshold Effect

### Overview
This project is for **MATH485 Fall 2025** under **Dr. Eve Vidalis**.

## Project Description and Constraints

**Project Name:** Random Graphs and the Threshold Effect

### Objective
Write programs that, given values of `n` and `p`, generates a random graph *G* ∈ *G(n, p)* and tests whether or not *G* has each of the following properties:

- *G* has an edge;
- *G* has a triangle subgraph;
- *G* is connected;
- *G* has a K<sub>4</sub> subgraph;
- *G* has a Hamilton cycle.

### Constraints & Requirements
- You may **not** use libraries to test these properties.
- You must explain and cite any algorithms you implement, together with an explanation of limitations on the input they can handle in reasonable time.

### Analysis & Reporting
For each property:
1.  Fix a spectrum of values of `n` that your program can handle in reasonable time.
2.  For various values of `p`, graph the probability *G* ∈ *G(n, p)* has the required property.
3.  Comment on the results, with reference to any theorems from class.

Produce naïve estimates of constants in thresholds so that a graph almost surely has these properties as *n* → ∞, and accompany with pen-and-paper arguments for any bounds (which may be crude).

> **Note:** You do not have to do this for every case, but choose some that interest you. If you avoid a particular case, you must explain why.

### Deliverables
You should write up your findings in a project report and prepare a presentation (which may be recorded or in person).
